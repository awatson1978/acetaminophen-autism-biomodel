## **Key Findings on Preprint and Submission Policies**

### **Preprint-Friendly Journals**

Most top-tier journals now accept preprints, with some actively encouraging them:

1. **Nature Medicine**
   - Encourages posting of preprints on servers of authors' choice
   - Authors must disclose preprint DOI upon submission
   - Contact: Submit through nature.com/nm
   - Format: Accepts Word, TeX/LaTeX, or PDF for initial submission

2. **Science Translational Medicine**
   - Accepts manuscripts up to 10,000 words with 8 figures
   - Allows preprints (check current policy on science.org)
   - Contact: Submit through science.org submission system
   - Format: Microsoft Word .docx required

3. **BMJ (British Medical Journal)**
   - **Strongly encourages preprints** - BMJ is actually a co-founder of medRxiv
   - Submit through: mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmj
   - Fully supports medRxiv posting

4. **JAMA Network Journals**
   - Policy varies by specific journal
   - Generally accepts preprints but verify for specific JAMA journal
   - Submit through: jamanetwork.com submission systems

### **GitHub Posting Considerations**

**You CAN post on GitHub**, but consider these factors:

1. **Preprint servers are preferred** over GitHub because:
   - They provide DOIs for citations
   - They're indexed by Google Scholar and PubMed
   - Journals recognize them formally
   - 144+ journals integrate directly with medRxiv for manuscript transfer

2. **Recommended approach:**
   - Post to **medRxiv** (for health/medical content) or **bioRxiv** (for basic biology)
   - Keep GitHub for code/data/supplementary materials
   - You cannot post to both medRxiv AND bioRxiv - it will result in withdrawal

### **Submission Strategy**

**DO NOT submit to multiple journals simultaneously!** This violates academic publishing ethics. Instead:

1. **Choose ONE journal** for initial submission
2. **Post to preprint server** (optional but recommended)
3. **Wait for decision** before considering another journal
4. If rejected, many journals offer **transfer services** to sister publications

### **Revised Recommendations**

Given EHP's closure to submissions, here's my updated strategy:

**Primary Target:** **Nature Medicine** (Commentary/Perspective)
- High impact, preprint-friendly
- Perfect for your "Faustian Bargains" framework
- 1,500-2,000 words for Commentary

**Secondary Target:** **Science Translational Medicine**
- Ideal for your systems biology approach
- 10,000 word limit accommodates full model
- Strong translational medicine focus

**Alternative:** **BMJ** (Analysis section)
- Most preprint-friendly (co-founded medRxiv!)
- Global reach to practitioners
- Strong policy influence

### **Action Steps**

1. **Post to medRxiv first**
   - This establishes priority and gets early feedback
   - Upload a single PDF with text and figures/tables
   - Include all authors' consent

2. **Prepare journal-specific version**
   - Follow each journal's formatting guidelines
   - Prepare cover letter explaining significance
   - Include preprint DOI in submission

3. **GitHub strategy**
   - Keep your LaTeX source, code, and data on GitHub
   - Add link to medRxiv preprint in README
   - This provides full transparency while maintaining journal compatibility

4. **Submission process**
   - Submit to ONE journal
   - Mention medRxiv preprint in cover letter
   - Wait for decision (typically 2-8 weeks for initial review)

### **Copyright Considerations**

- Posting preprints does NOT affect copyright
- Authors may choose any Creative Commons license for preprints
- Journals will require copyright transfer or license ONLY after acceptance
